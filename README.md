## Quick Setup
Practicum.jar is an executable jar, so all it requires is a Java 8 runtime environment. The directory with Practicum.jar should also contain the HotKeys, Cmds, Typing, and Custom directories from this repo. Once these requirements have been met, Practicum should properly execute on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
